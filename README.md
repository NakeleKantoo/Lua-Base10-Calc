# Lua-Base10-Calc
A Lua base-10 calculator

# Usage

```
lua calc.lua <number> <operation> <number>
```

The operations are + - x / ^ !

# What I plan to do:
- Improve speed (can we not use so many for's?)
- Make it capable of interpreting whole formulas and not just a single operation
- Add decimals
